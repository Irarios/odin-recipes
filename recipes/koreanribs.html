    <h2>
      Kalbi is a staple of Korean fine dining but is too expensive in
      restaurants
    </h2>

    <p>
      It is simple to make at home and will leave your guests asking for more.
      Total time includes marinating time. It's traditionally served sliced,
      rolled in romaine lettuce leaves with white rice, lightly browned garlic
      slices, and gochujang (Korean red pepper paste).
