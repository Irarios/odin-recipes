    <h2>
      I tried to combine the traditional Italian beef sandwich with the French
      dip sandwich with a little nod to the pulled pork sandwich
    </h2>

    <p>
      Instead of using thinly sliced roast beef, I used stew beef, with
      apologies to my friends from Chicago
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ pounds boneless beef chuck, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1½ teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
      <li>3 cups chicken broth, or as needed</li>
      <li>4 ciabatta rolls, sliced in half</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped giardiniera (pickled Italian vegetables)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season beef with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Heat vegetable oil in
        a heavy pot over high heat. Cook and stir beef in hot oil until browned,
        5 to 8 minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir garlic, vinegar, oregano, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, thyme, rosemary, 1
        teaspoon black pepper, bay leaf, and red pepper flakes into beef. Pour
        enough chicken broth into beef mixture to cover the meat by 1 inch and
        bring to a simmer
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover pot with a lid, reduce heat to low, and simmer until meat is
        fork-tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer meat with a strainer or slotted spoon to a separate pot; pour
        about 1/4 cup of meat broth into pot. Use a wooden spoon to gently break
        meat into smaller chunks. Cover pot with a lid or aluminum foil and keep
        warm
      </li>
      <li>
        Skim excess grease from top of broth remaining in the first pot; season
        with salt and pepper to taste. Cover pot with a lid or aluminum foil and
        keep broth warm
      </li>
      <li>
        Lay halves of a roll out on a work surface and spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons
        meat broth over each half. Top bottom half of roll with a generous
        portion of meat and a spoonful of pickled vegetables. Place tops on
        sandwich. Repeat with remaining buns, broth, meat, and pickled
        vegetables to make 3 more sandwiches
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon hot meat broth into ramekins and top each ramekin with 1/2
        teaspoon parsley. Serve sandwiches with hot broth for dipping
      </li>
    </ol>
